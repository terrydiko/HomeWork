his template creates an s3 and an ec2 instance. 
Backend to store statefile in an s3 bucket already existing in my account
The instance has full s3 bucket access policy/role and also uploads all files from /var/log to the s3 bucket
Resources are deployed in a default VPC - so no vpc or subnet was created
out puts : bucket arn & instance id

Difficulties - our bash script did not work initially -  we made some modifications to it, then boom!



This was a group effort!!!
